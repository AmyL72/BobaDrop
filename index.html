        <p>Boba, also known as bubble tea, is a popular Taiwanese drink that combines milk tea with chewy tapioca pearls. Originating in the
            1980s, it has since become a global phenomenon, especially among young people. The drink is typically served cold with a wide 
            straw to accommodate the tapioca balls, which are made from cassava starch and have a sweet, gummy texture. Boba comes in many flavors 
            and variations, including fruit teas, slushies, and even cheese foam toppings. Its unique combination of creamy tea and chewy pearls offers 
            both a drink and a snack in one, making it a fun and refreshing treat (ChatGPT, 2025).</p>
